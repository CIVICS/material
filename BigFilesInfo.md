To: Dazza Greenwood <dazza@civics.com>


Hi Dazza Greenwood,

It's time to start versioning large files on GitHub.com! Support for Git LFS is now enabled for your organization: CIVICS.

Getting started

Download and install the Git command line extension for Mac, Windows, or Linux (or see our full list of pre-built binaries). You only have to set up Git LFS once, but make sure you have the latest release (v0.5.1) installed.

Select the file types you'd like Git LFS to manage (or directly edit your .gitattributes). You can configure additional file extensions at anytime.

git lfs track "*.psd"
Commit and push to GitHub.

git add file.psd
git commit -m "Add design file"
git push origin master
Storage and bandwidth

Your account includes 1GB of storage and 1GB/month of bandwidth for no additional charge. If you need more data, you can upgrade your plan at any time:

Technical support

If you need help with any technical or billing-related issues, please check out our documentation and email us at git-lfs@github.com.


Thanks,

The Git LFS Team
